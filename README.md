# Create a note and open it with Vim, or any editor

If you do not have time but you need create a new note for a rapid annotation. Use this aplication for this and get things done. As you can see, this is a bat file and only will work in Windows 10. 

## How to use

Just open the file fastAnnotation.bat and edit the path (put the full path) that you want to save the file. After this, put the .bat in the most comfortable area for you in your computer (I use this in Desktop) and click upon it.
